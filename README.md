# LangChain Documentation Helper

# Overview

**LangChain Documentation Helper** is a Python project that uses LangChain to gather information out of *LangChain* official documentation. It uses *Pinecone* as a vectorstore for the embeddings, the *ConversationalRetrievalChain* to interact with the embeddings via user prompt (with *chat_history*) and *streamlit* as the frontend.
